CVFS -Customised Virtual File System

---
* This project provides all functionality to the user which is same as Linux File system. 

* It provides necessary commands, system calls implementations of file system through 
customised shell. 
* In this project we implement all necessary data structures of file system like Incore Inode 
Table, File Table, UAREA, User File Descriptor table. 
* Using this project we can use every system level functionality of Linux operating system on any 
other operating system platform. 
* We provide our own customised shell to interact with the customised database management 
system

### 6. **Description of the Project**

The **CVFS** project emulates a simplified version of a Unix-like file system. It enables the user to create, read, write, open, close, and delete files, all within a virtual environment using user-defined data structures like inodes, superblocks, file tables, and directory listings.

---

### 7. **Data Structures Used**

* `SUPERBLOCK`: Manages total and free inodes
* `INODE`: Represents metadata for files
* `FILETABLE`: Represents open file instance
* `UFDT`: User File Descriptor Table â€“ links files to file tables



### 8. **Flow of the Project**

1. Initialize SuperBlock & DILB
2. Input command from user (via CLI)
3. Parse command and arguments
4. Match to supported system calls
5. Execute system-like operation (create, open, read, etc.)
6. Print output and wait for next input
